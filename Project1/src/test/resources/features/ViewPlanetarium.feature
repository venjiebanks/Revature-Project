  As a user I want to see my planets and moons added to the Planetarium so I can track my findings

  Scenario: Login should allow for viewing owned resources
    Given   the user is logged in on the home page
    Then    they should see their planets and moons

  Scenario: Users not logged in should not be able to view the home page and its resources
    Given   the user is not logged in
    When    the user tries to directly access the home page
    Then    the user should be denied access
